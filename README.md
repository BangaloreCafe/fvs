Feed back vertex set

Finding the feedback vertex Set of a directed graph
-------------------------------------------------------

Feedback vertex set is set of vertices in a directed graph removing which 
will eliminate all the cycles of the graph

Algorithm by Ashutosh Trivedi and Sumit Singh Chauhan

![Alt text](doc/1.jpeg?raw=true "Formal Documentation")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Limitation : Graph should not have self loop and parallel loop parallel loop is loop between
	two vertices.
					
	Takes a component from strongly connected component and returns the best one which  can eliminate
	most of the cycles in that component.
   
    Hurestics : If by removing a vertex gives maximum number of strongly connected  component in
                the graph made by only that component, then consider that vertex
			   and call the other strongly connected components recursivly.

Fitness Function : maximum no of strongly connected component.
